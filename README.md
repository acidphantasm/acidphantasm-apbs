# Welcome to PBS (Progressive Bot System)

The goal of this mod is to provide a system that allows all bots to progress with the player. 

In vanilla, scavs are a minor annoyance once you reach level 30+. This aims to change that, they may not always have the best ammo but they won't always be rocking crappy shotguns or low level weapons.

## General Notes

This mod has only been tested with SAIN, SWAG+Donuts, QuestingBots, and LootingBots.

This mod may have missing mods or templates for weapons. If you see errors or warning - REPORT THEM.

This mod may have issues that prevent the game from working - if this happens, REMOVE THE MOD and REPORT THEM.

Currently all bots that are due to spawn or have spawned are logged inside the \user\mods\acidphantasm-progressivebotsystem\logs\ folder. These logs are wiped when you restart the server. These may be needed to provide support, and are a nice thing to review if you happen to want to know everything that has or will spawn.

### Current Features
- All AI will level with you.
- All AI have a tiering system.
- All AI will use modded weapons that you have installed.
- USEC spawn with weapons that you would expect from non-Russian forces.
- BEAR spawn with weapons that you would expect from Russian forces.
- Scavs pull a weapon from the Tier they have spawned from (any weapon available in that tier from USEC or BEAR can be chosen.)
  - Scavs pull from ammo pools that do not contains meta ammo. I felt this was too easy a source of ammunition. This is subject to change.

  - Boss guards pull a Tier4 weapon from the combined pools of USEC & BEAR.
