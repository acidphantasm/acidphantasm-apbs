                    Nearly every change is tracked by the application and will notify you at the bottom right of pending changes to be saved.
                    <MudText Align="Align.Center" Typo="Typo.body2" Inline=false>
                    In addition, you can click on the button to view a list of changes that are pending.
                        <MudText Align="Align.Center" Typo="Typo.body2" Inline=false>
                            If you want to discard any changes that you have made, you can click on 'Reload Config' at the top right to revert everything back to it's last saved state.

                <MudText Align="Align.Center" Typo="Typo.body2">At the bottom left of your window are toggles to have the application automatically show you 'Undo' & 'Default' buttons as you're making changes.</MudText>

                <MudText Align="Align.Center" Typo="Typo.body2" Inline=false>
                    The 'Undo' button will appear when you've made a change and have yet to save the configuration.
                    <MudText Align="Align.Center" Typo="Typo.body2" Inline=false>
                        This button will effectively remove your changes (only for the setting next to which it resides) and set it back to what it was on the last saved state of your config.

                    The 'Default' button will only appear, if enabled, if your settings differ from the defaults that I have configured.
                    <MudText Align="Align.Center" Typo="Typo.body2" Inline=false>
                        It serves only as a quick way to return the setting to it's default state.
